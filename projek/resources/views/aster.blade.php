                        <p style="font-size : 20px; font-weight: lighter;">The September birth flower. 
                        This fall-blooming herb with daisy-like flowers stands for Wisdom, Faith, and Valor.
                         Named after the Greek word for "Star" due to its blooms resembling a star, Asters symbolize love, 
                         wisdom, faith, and color. The Aster flower blooms in pink, red, white, lilac and mauve. 
                         This flower became a symbol of love when in Greek mythology it was placed on the altars for the gods. 
                         So now, when you send a bouquet featuring this vibrant bloom, the message of "Take Care Of Yourself For Me" 
                         is implied. It conveys deep emotional love and affection for someone.(gidasflowers)<p>
